# The Book Hub Audiobook

There are lot of literary classics that are in the public domain now and there is a community of volunteers reading them out loud into audiobooks for people to listen. This, however, doesn't get the attention that it deserves. 

In today's world, where everything is moving fast and people are always outraged about one thing or the other, it becomes important to understand and empathize with people of a different time and classic literary works are a good medium for that. 

Also since language dictates how people think, a phenomenon called linguistic relativity, incorporating words from some of the best works in history is necessary to escape the confines of language dictated by the newest fad in social media. Each of these works has survived the test of time and the community of volunteers have put in hours and hours of their time to turn it an audiobook because of the value they saw this could provide the society. 

So we decided to build a modern react-based audio player for these audiobooks, in an attempt to get more attention to this.
